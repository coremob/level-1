        This specification describes the core set of technologies that define the baseline platform
        for mobile Web applications to target. It does not create any new technology but rather syndicates
        them into a globally coherent view of the mobile Web platform.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The goal of the Core Mobile Web Platform Community Group is to accelerate the adoption of the Mobile Web as a compelling platform for the development of modern mobile Web applications. In order to achieve this mission, the CG brings developers, equipment manufacturers, browser vendors, operators and other relevant members of the industry together to agree on core features developers can depend on.</p>

        <p>This specification is the result of this work. It attempts to carefully balances developer needs and implementation constraints as of today. As the platform evolves and new technologies become broadly available, additional levels will be layered on top of it.

      <h2>Markup</h2>
      <p>This section describes requirements for markup languages and related features.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>HTML5</h2>
        <p>User agents MUST support HTML5 [[!HTML5]].</p>
        <p class='issue' data-number=1>Some <a href="https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=14702">critical AppCache issues</a> are being <a href="http://html5.org/tools/web-apps-tracker?from=7135&amp;to=7136">fixed</a> in the HTML Living Standard spec. Unfortunately, these fixes aren't brought (yet) to the HTML5 spec because they are considered new features belonging in HTML.next. What should the group's position be with regards to that?</p>
        <p class='note'>Implementors should pay particular attention to the quality of implementation of the <code>audio</code> element. <code>audio</code> elements are commonly used in games to play background music and sound effects. It is recommended that implementations support playing 8 audio files in parallel without audible artifacts and provide sub 10ms latency.</p>
        <p class='issue' data-number=2>Can the latency requirements be lightened a bit. Sub 10ms seems ideal, slightly longer latency times may be acceptable for most use cases.</p>
      </section>

        <h2><code>meta</code> Elements</h2>
        <p>User agents MUST support CSS Device Adaptation [[!CSS-ADAPTATION]] as specified through a <code>meta</code> viewport element.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Application Configuration</h2>
        <p class='issue' data-number=6>WebApps WG is <a href="http://www.w3.org/2012/webapps/charter/Overview.html#deliverables">chartered</a> to work on this and has two related specs: Widget Packaging and Configuration [[WIDGETS]] (which has had little traction among the main vendors), and Web Application Manifest Format and Management APIs [[WEBAPPS-MANIFEST-API]] (which is still an early Editor's draft).</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>View Orientation</h2>
        <p class='issue' data-number=7>This is a new deliverable of the WebApps WG. See the WG's <a href='http://www.w3.org/2012/webapps/charter/'>charter</a> for details. No spec to link to for the moment. Could also end up as an attribute of <a href="#application-configuration">Application Configuration</a>.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Chromeless Mode</h2>
        <p class='issue' data-number=8>Within the scope of the WebApps WG's <a href='http://www.w3.org/2012/webapps/charter/'>charter</a>. Could end up as an attribute of <a href="#application-configuration">Application Configuration</a>.</p>

          <p class='issue' data-number=9>CSS Values is a WD. Most of the common content of CSS Values is already included in CSS 2.1.

          <p>User agents MUST support CSS Text [[!CSS3TEXT]].</p>
          <p class='issue' data-number=13>Spec in WD. We're interested in a small subset of CSS Text, mainly text-shadow. Like CSS Values, a lot what is of interest is already covered by CSS 2.1.</p>
