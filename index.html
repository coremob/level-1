        This specification describes the core set of technologies that define the baseline platform
        for mobile Web applications to target. It does not create any new technology but rather syndicates
        them into a globally coherent view of the mobile Web platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is Level 1, the second iteration, building atop Level 0 [[!COREMOB-0]]. As the platform evolves 
        and new technologies become broadly available, additional levels, which are guaranteed to remain 
        backwards compatible, will be layered on top of the present one.

        <p class='issue'>
          Should we make conformance to the whole spec a requirement or should we break it down and require support for parts of it only?
        </p>
        <p class='issue'>
          HTML5 is currently a Last Call Working Draft. Can we still make it a normative reference?

        <h2>HTML Media Capture</h2>
        <p>
          User agents MUST support HTML Media Capture [[!HTMLMEDIACAPTURE]].
        </p>
        <p class='note'>
          When presented with a <code>capture</code> attribute set to <code>"camera"</code>, <code>"camcorder"</code>, or <code>"microphone"</code> User Agents are urged to invoke a file picker of a specific capture control type rather than of a generic type. E.g. when the <code>capture</code> attribute is <code>"camera"</code>, a mobile phone should let the user take a picture using the device's default camera application in fullscreen mode.
        </p>
        <p class='issue'>
          HTML Media Capture is just a Working Draft at this point.
        </p>
        <p class='issue'>
          The <code>capture</code> attribute is merely a hint. Documented use cases would really require invoking the file picker of the relevant capture control type. Started a <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-device-apis/2012Jun/0031.html">thread</a> about this on public-device-apis@w3c.org.

          Not sure that this is clear enough, and it probably requires more than what is supported.

        <section class='informative'>
          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>
            Certain web applications might be designed to be used strictly in
            portrait or landscape mode. This is often the case for games.
            The View Orientation API enables the application developer to signal
            this preference to the user agent. It is however not meant to enable
            use cases which are better dealt with at the user agent level. For
            example, locking the user agent in portrait mode to read while lying
            in bed.

        <h2>HTML Media Capture</h2>
        <section class='informative'>
          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>
            The main use case for camera access on mobile devices is simply… to take
            pictures. The declarative [[!HTMLMEDIACAPTURE]] API is a perfect fit
            for this use case.
          </p>
          <p>
            As [[!HTMLMEDIACAPTURE]] relies on the security and privacy
            protections provided by the [[HTML5]] <code>&lt;input type="file"&gt;</code>
            and the [[FILE-API]] specifications, there is no need to prompt the user to give access to
            the camera. Other benefits of this approach allows user agents to save
            pictures directly to the device's photo gallery if they so wish,
            add a physical shutter button, or provide photo editing functions
            such as cropping, filtering, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            [[!HTMLMEDIACAPTURE]] isn't a replacement for a lower-level API
            such as [[MEDIACAPTURE-API]] as it doesn't fulfill the same use-cases.
            Both solutions are complementary.
          </p>
          <p class='note'>
            On mobile devices, the most common use case for [[!HTMLMEDIACAPTURE]]
            with a <code>capture</code> attribute set to <code>"camera"</code> is to
            access the device's camera to take a picture. User agents are therefore
            strongly encouraged to launch the system's camera application in fullscreen
            mode directly upon activation rather than go through a two step process
            involving a media capture picker.

            Capturing pictures isn't enough. One might want to store it on the device or
            (asynchronously) upload it to a remote server. Fully supporting camera
            access therefore also implies supporting the following:

            <li><a href="#file-api">File API</a>, for access to the data returned by the system's camera application,</li>
