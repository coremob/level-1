        This specification describes the core set of technologies that define the baseline platform
        for mobile Web applications to target. It does not create any new technology but rather syndicates
        them into a globally coherent view of the mobile Web platform.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The goal of the Core Mobile Web Platform Community Group is to accelerate the adoption of the Mobile Web as a compelling platform for the development of modern mobile Web applications. In order to achieve this mission, the CG brings developers, equipment manufacturers, browser vendors, operators and other relevant members of the industry together to agree on core features developers can depend on.</p>

        <p>This specification is the result of this work. It attempts to carefully balances developer needs and implementation constraints as of today. As the platform evolves and new technologies become broadly available, additional levels will be layered on top of it.

      <h2>Markup</h2>
      <p>This section describes requirements for markup languages and related features.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>HTML5</h2>
        <p>User agents MUST support HTML5 [[!HTML5]].</p>
        <p class='issue'>Some <a href="https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=14702">critical AppCache issues</a> are being <a href="http://html5.org/tools/web-apps-tracker?from=7135&amp;to=7136">fixed</a> in the HTML Living Standard spec. Unfortunately, these fixes aren't brought (yet) to the HTML5 spec because they are considered new features belonging in HTML.next. What should the group's position be with regards to that?</p>
        <p class='note'>Implementors should pay particular attention to the quality of implementation of the <code>audio</code> element. <code>audio</code> elements are commonly used in games to play background music and sound effects. It is recommended that implementations support playing 8 audio files in parallel without audible artifacts and provide sub 10ms latency.</p>
        <p class='issue'>Can the latency requirements be lightened a bit. Sub 10ms seems ideal, slightly longer latency times may be acceptable for most use cases.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>HTML Media Capture</h2>
        <p>User agents MUST support HTML Media Capture [[!HTMLMEDIACAPTURE]].</p>
        <p class='note'>
          When presented with a <code>capture</code> attribute set to <code>"camera"</code>, <code>"camcorder"</code>, or <code>"microphone"</code> User Agents are urged to invoke a file picker of a specific capture control type rather than of a generic type. E.g. when the <code>capture</code> attribute is <code>"camera"</code>, a mobile phone should let the user take a picture using the device's default camera application in fullscreen mode.</p>
        <p class='issue'>HTML Media Capture is just a Working Draft at this point.</p>
        <p class='issue'>The <code>capture</code> attribute is merely a hint. Documented use cases would really require invoking the file picker of the relevant capture control type. Started a <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-device-apis/2012Jun/0031.html">thread</a> about this on public-device-apis@w3c.org.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>SVG</h2>
        <p>User agents MUST support Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) 1.1 (Second Edition) [[!SVG11]].</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2><code>meta</code> Elements</h2>
        <p>User agents MUST support CSS Device Adaptation [[!CSS-ADAPTATION]] as specified through a <code>meta</code> viewport element.</p>
        <p class='issue'>This spec is currently <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/current-work">marked as exploratory</a> by the CSS WG. Does not seem to be too much of an issue given the meta syntax won't change.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Application Configuration</h2>
        <p class='issue'>Although the WebApps WG is <a href="http://www.w3.org/2012/webapps/charter/Overview.html#deliverables">chartered</a> to work on this, there is no spec yet outside of Widget Packaging and Configuration [[WIDGETS]], and an <a href="https://people.mozilla.com/~anarayanan/webapps.html">early proposal</a> by Mozilla.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>View Orientation</h2>
        <p class='issue'>This is a new deliverable of the WebApps WG. See the WG's <a href='http://www.w3.org/2012/webapps/charter/'>charter</a> for details. No spec to link to for the moment. Could also end up as an attribute of <a href="#application-configuration">Application Configuration</a>.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Full-screen Mode</h2>
        <p class='issue'>Within the scope of the WebApps WG's <a href='http://www.w3.org/2012/webapps/charter/'>charter</a>. Could end up as an attribute of <a href="#application-configuration">Application Configuration</a>.</p>
      </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Style</h2>
      <p>This section defines requirements for CSS and other, styling-related features.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Core</h2>
        <p>User agents MUST support CSS 2.1 [[!CSS21]].</p>
        <p>User agents MUST support CSS Backgrounds and Borders [[!CSS3-BG]].</p>
        <p>User agents MUST support CSS Color [[!CSS3COLOR]].</p>
        <p>User agents MUST support CSS Values [[!CSS3VAL]].</p>
        <p class='issue'>CSS Values is a WD. Most of the common content of CSS Values is already included in CSS 2.1. There are some features that would be welcomed additions, notably <code>calc()</code>, <code>rem</code> unit, but also some that don't seem to have a lot of traction (e.g. <code>cycle()</code>).</p>
        <p>User agents MUST support CSS Image Values and Replaced Content [[!CSS3-IMAGES]].</p>
        <p class='issue'>CSS Image Values is a CR. Questionable content is marked at risk, which is reassuring.</p>
        <p>User agents MUST support CSS Media Queries [[!CSS3-MEDIAQUERIES]].</p>
        <p class='issue'>Request for momentum scrolling (e.g. <code>-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch</code>) are extremely common. Unfortunately, there is no spec effort at this point.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Layout</h2>
        <p>User agents MUST support CSS Flexible Box Layout [[!FLEXBOX]].</p>
        <p class='issue'>Flexbox is a WD, it was re-written from the ground-up <em>after</em> Mozilla's initial implementation. Unsure about the position of implementors outside of WebKit.</p>
        <p>User agents MUST support CSS Transforms [[!CSS3-TRANSFORMS]].</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Typography</h2>
        <p>User agents MUST support CSS Fonts [[!CSS3-FONTS]].</p>
        <p>User agents MUST support <acronym title="Web Open Font Format">WOFF</acronym> [[!WOFF]].</p>
        <p>User agents MUST support CSS Text [[!CSS3TEXT]].</p>
        <p class='issue'>Spec in WD. We're interested in a small subset of CSS Text, mainly text-shadow. Like CSS Values, a lot what is of interest is already covered by CSS 2.1.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Animations and Transitions</h2>
        <p>User agents MUST support CSS Animations [[!CSS3-ANIMATIONS]].</p>
        <p>User agents MUST support CSS Transitions [[!CSS3-TRANSITIONS]].</p>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Scripting</h2>
      <p>This section defines which scripting support in language and APIs are required.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>ECMAScript</h2>
        <p>User agents MUST support ECMAScript, Edition 5.1 [[!ECMA-262-51]].</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>DOM</h2>
        <p>User agents MUST support the DOM4 API [[!DOM4]].</p>
        <p>User agents MUST support the Selectors API level 2 [[!SELECTORS-API2]].</p>
        <p>User agents SHOULD support Touch Events version 1 [[!TOUCH-EVENTS]].</p>
        <p>User agents MUST support CSSOM View [[!CSSOM-VIEW]].</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Storage</h2>
        <p>User agents MUST support the Web Storage API [[!WEBSTORAGE]].</p>
        <p>User agents MUST support the Indexed Database API [[!INDEXEDDB]].</p>
        <p>User agents MUST support the File API [[!FILE-API]].</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Networking</h2>
        <p>User agents MUST support the XMLHttpRequest API [[!XMLHTTPREQUEST]].</p>
        <p class='issue'>The Editor folded level 1 and 2 in the same spec recently, but this isn't reflected in /TR yet.</p>
        <p>User agents MUST support the Web Messaging API [[!POSTMSG]].</p>
        <p>User agents MUST support the Web Workers API [[!WEBWORKERS]].</p>
        <p class='issue'>Do we need both Shared and Web Workers?</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Sensors</h2>
        <p>User agents MUST support the Geolocation API [[!GEOLOCATION-API]].</p>
        <p>User agents MUST support the DeviceOrientation Event [[!DEVICE-ORIENTATION]].</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Multimedia</h2>
        <p>User agents MUST support the Canvas2D API [[!CANVAS-2D]].</p>
        <p class='note'>Implementors should pay attention to the performance characteristics of the <code>canvas</code> element which is particularly well suited for the development of 2D and isometric games. In order to meet the expectations of users, implementations should be capable of running such games at 30fps in full-screen mode.</p>
        <p>User agents MUST support the Timing control for script-based animations API [[!ANIMATION-TIMING]].</p>
      </section>

    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Network</h2>
      <p>User agents MUST support HTTP 1.1 [[!HTTP11]].</p>
      <p>User agents MUST support Cross-Origin Resource Sharing [[!CORS]].</p>
      <p>User agents MUST support the <code>data:</code> URI scheme [[!RFC2397]].</p>
      <p>User agents MUST support the <code>mailto:</code> URI scheme [[!RFC6068]].</p>
